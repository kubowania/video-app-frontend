```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET={your_dataset}
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID={your_sanity_project_id}
```

### `npm i`

Run the command above to install all the packages

### Start the Project

Now run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
